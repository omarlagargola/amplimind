Steps to run the tic tac toe console application:

Install dependencies with *npm i*. If for some reason does not work, try to install them independently.(*npm i prompt-sync*, *npm i jest*).

The code of the tic tac toe game is in the file: *tic_tac_toe.js*

The code related to the tests is in: *tic_tac_toe.spec.js*

To run the application you can execute: *node -e 'require("./tic_tac_toe.js").init()'*

You can also uncomment the line 110 and execute the command *node tic_tac_toe.js*.
But keep in mind that if you want to execute tests, that line must be commented.

To execute test, run the script: *npm run test*

Have fun! And sorry if I made some mistakes, I am only human after all, don't put your blame on me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3wKzyIN1yk
